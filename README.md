# genomic_landscape_Karimata
Tier 2 project discovering genomic patterns of introgression across the Karimata Strait  

## Programs used 

Variant calling: SNPArcher (https://github.com/harvardinformatics/snpArcher)

Data filtering and PCA: PLINK (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/)

Population genetic clustring: ADMIXTURE (https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html)

Nucleotide diversity, Fst and Pixy: Pixy (https://pixy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)


As Pixy requires python between 3.6 and 3.7, need to create two conda environments for the program installations.
